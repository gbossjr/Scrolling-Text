    <string name="article_subtitle">Dear Mama</string>
    <string name="article_text">When I was young, me and my mama had beef
\n17 years old, kicked out on the streets
\nThough back at the time I never thought I\'d see her face
\nAin\'t a woman alive that could take my mama\'s place
\nSuspended from school
\nAnd scared to go home, I was a fool
\nWith the big boys breaking all the rules
\nI shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
\nWe was poorer than the other little kids
\nAnd even though we had different daddies, the same drama
\nWhen things went wrong we\'d blame mama
\nI reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
\nHuggin\' on my mama from a jail cell
\nAnd who\'d think in elementary, hey
\nI\'d see the penitentiary one day?
\nAnd running from the police, that\'s right
\nMama catch me, put a whoopin\' to my backside
\nAnd even as a crack fiend, mama
\nYou always was a black queen, mama
\nI finally understand
\nFor a woman it ain\'t easy trying to raise a man
\nYou always was committed
\nA poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
\nThere\'s no way I can pay you back, but the plan
\nIs to show you that I understand; you are appreciated
